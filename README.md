### Python Functions Using Mac Text to Speech
***************** 
These are some functions to use text to speech with Python on a Mac.

***************

```python

from saystuff import *

sayit()

introduce("random")
introduce("Ralph")

everybody(man_names)

discuss("Hey, How are you?", "Me?, Oh, I am fine")

```
***************

Mess around with the different functions and if you submit a pull request to fix or change something I would love to accept it since I am learning Git  and have not collaborated on anything yet.
